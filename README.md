This Maritime Information Sharing Environment (MISE) GitHub site is an
unofficial 3rd party demo. See the [MISE website](https://mise.mda.gov/)
for the official source material.

The MISE may be understood in terms of a 
"[common profile](http://pi2.ida.org/common-profile)" whereby a single
reference view is expanded on by technical guidance views, each of which may
have sub-views, either providing further technical guidance or details about
specific implementations:
